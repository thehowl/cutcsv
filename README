cutcsv - the csv swiss army knife (version 0.2.3)

Usage: cutcsv OPTION... [FILE...]
Print selected CSV fields from each specified FILE to standard output.
Select one or more fields using -c and/or -f. At least one must be selected.
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

        -f <LIST>   Print the specified comma-separated list of fields or ranges
        -c <COLUMN> Select fields whose column name (value of the first line)
                    matches COLUMN.
        -d <CHAR>   Use CHAR as a delimiter (defaults to ',')
        -D <STRING> Use STRING as the output separator (in case of multiple fields).
                    Defaults to the input delimiter.
        -r          Skip one row from the top of the file (header).
        -h          Show this help message.
        -v          Be verbose

Each LIST is made up of one range, or many ranges separated by commas,
in a similar fashion to the UNIX 'cut' program.
Selected input is written in the same order that it is read, and is written
exactly once. Each range is one of:

  N     N'th field, counted from 1
  N-    from N'th field, to end of line
  N-M   from N'th to M'th (included) field
  -M    from first to M'th (included) field
